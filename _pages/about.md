I am a graduate student pursuing my MS in Computer Science at NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and will be completing my graduation in May 2023. I completed my undergraduate degree from Manipal Institute of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering in July 2018. 

I am an incoming Software Engineering Intern at Google in the Android Automotive OS team. I have worked with Samsung Research Institute as a Software Developer for 3 years in India wherein I was working on developing features and building backend APIs for the Samsung Keyboard application.

I am an avid programmer with an interest in developing distributed systems, backend systems, and deep learning systems.
